![Seattle Central College logo][logo]

For my Autumn 2019 directed fieldwork (DFW), I'll be a teaching assistant (TA) for an information literacy class at Seattle Central College. I'll be working for a librarian instructor, teaching allied health students about information literacy as it applies to evidence-based medicine.
