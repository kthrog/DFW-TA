# Autumn 2019 DFW: TAing Information Literacy at Seattle Central College
For my Autumn 2019 directed fieldwork (DFW), I'll be a teaching assistant (TA) for an information literacy class at [Seattle Central College](https://seattlecentral.edu). I'll be working for a librarian instructor, teaching allied health students about information literacy as it intersects with evidence-based medicine.
