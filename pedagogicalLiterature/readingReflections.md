## Reading Reflections

**Reading Reflection, #1**

*Reading:* Keer, G. (2010). Critical pedagogy and information literacy in community colleges. In Drabinski, E., Kumbier, A., & Accardi (Eds.), *Critical library instruction: Theories and methods* (149-149). Duluth, MN: Library Juice Press.

*Question for reflection: How do you define critical information literacy for yourself? Do you think this is a valuable perspective on our work?*
- I define critical information literacy as evaluating information through a critical lens -- knowing questions to ask about information encountered, so as to assess its validity and social context. For librarians teaching critical information literacy, we should strive to teach students the role of information literacy both in their day-to-day lives and in their role as learners and researchers. Critical information literacy ultimately helps students understand the impact and importance of information for them as a whole person. 
- The perspective Keer presents in the book chapter is very helpful, particularly in the context of community college learners, who may be seeking a more practical, rather than purely theoretical, approach to their education. I agree with this approach, as I tend to think that combining theory and practice is a successful strategy for engaging learners of all kinds. Keer's version of critical information literacy is also more inclusive, and more approachable for first-time researchers. I particularly liked that Keer encourages a mindset that approaches knowledge construction as a social construct--one that can be oppressive, particularly for marginalized audiences--and also emphasizes that research can bring up feelings of inadequacy in us all. Acknowledging the potentially negative emotions associated with information evaluation and research can help us work together to flip the script into a more positive, engaging experience for students. 

**Reading Reflection, #2**

*Reading:* hooks, b. (1994). Teaching to Transgress. New York, NY: Routledge.

So far, I've read the introduction, as well as chapters one and two, and I am struck by how much I resonate with hook's words, written more than twenty years ago, both personally and professionally. 

Because hooks advocates so strongly for self-actualization, and for an intersection of mind, body, and soul in the classroom, it seems appropriate to talk a little about my educational background. I was homeschooled up until college, and that education was similar to what hooks experienced in her early education. It was joyful, it was exciting, and it fueled my passsion and curiosity. It wasn't until I entered undergraduate studies, and later graduate school, that I started to notice how decidedly un-exciting the academic environment can be, as well as how oppressive it can be. Unlike hooks, I haven't had to contend with racial bias in addition to the "'banking system' of education" (1994, p. 14), but I completely agree that there's an emphasis on passive consumption of information, and not as much support as I want there to be for active student participation in co-creating learning experiences.
