## Reading Reflections

**Reading Reflection, #1**

*Reading:* Keer, G. (2010). Critical pedagogy and information literacy in community colleges. In Drabinski, E., Kumbier, A., & Accardi (Eds.), *Critical library instruction: Theories and methods* (149-159). Duluth, MN: Library Juice Press.

*Question for reflection: How do you define critical information literacy for yourself? Do you think this is a valuable perspective on our work?*
- I define critical information literacy as evaluating information through a critical lens -- knowing questions to ask about information encountered, so as to assess its validity and social context. For librarians teaching critical information literacy, we should strive to teach students the role of information literacy both in their day-to-day lives and in their role as learners and researchers. Critical information literacy ultimately helps students understand the impact and importance of information for them as a whole person. 
- The perspective Keer presents in the book chapter is very helpful, particularly in the context of community college learners, who may be seeking a more practical, rather than purely theoretical, approach to their education. I agree with this approach, as I tend to think that combining theory and practice is a successful strategy for engaging learners of all kinds. Keer's version of critical information literacy is also more inclusive, and more approachable for first-time researchers. I particularly liked that Keer encourages a mindset that approaches knowledge construction as a social construct--one that can be oppressive, particularly for marginalized audiences--and also emphasizes that research can bring up feelings of inadequacy in us all. Acknowledging the potentially negative emotions associated with information evaluation and research can help us work together to flip the script into a more positive, engaging experience for students. 

**Reading Reflection, #2**

*Reading:* hooks, b. (1994). *Teaching to Transgress.* New York, NY: Routledge.

So far, I've read the introduction, as well as chapters one and two, and I am struck by how much I resonate with hook's words both personally and professionally, even though they were written more than twenty years ago. 

Because hooks advocates so strongly for self-actualization, and for intersection of mind, body, and soul in the classroom, it seems appropriate to talk briefly about my educational background. I was homeschooled up until college, and at least based on the descriptions she provides, it seems that my educational experience was similar to hooks' experiences in her early education. It was joyful, it was exciting, and it fueled my passsion and curiosity. It wasn't until I began my undergraduate studies, and later graduate school, that I started to notice how decidedly un-exciting the academic environment can be, as well as how oppressive it can be. Unlike hooks, I haven't had to contend with racial bias in addition to the "banking system' of education" (1994, p. 14 -- originally proposed by Freire), but I completely agree that academia tends to emphasize passive consumption of information, instead of supporting active student participation in co-creating learning experiences.

Thinking about my own experiences, and hooks' observations, I wonder: how can I make learning more exciting for students? I can only imagine how classes might go if students were asked more often, "What about this topic excites you?" and if more co-design concepts, e.g., co-production of knowledge, were incorporated into classrooms. I've seen this in action before, when I took Participatory Design in Libraries, and put co-design and co-creation of knowledge principles into action while teaching young children how to code and program an Arduino, back in fall quarter 2019. From that experience, I know that it can be really exciting and fun for both the learners and the instructor. I also appreciated hooks' statement that students want to be seen as "whole human beings" (p. 15) and that to accomplish this, we should not reinforce the concept of public and private as separate entities, nor should we insist that students only bring our minds to school--instead we should encourage them to bring their bodies and souls, too. 

One way that I think this can be done is by showing genuine passion and excitement for the topics I care about, and show how they affect my life, both personally and professionally, and by inviting students to do the same. Another way is to show the value of the topic beyond the classroom, that it can have an impact on them personally, both as a student and as a non-student. An additional way is being honest about where I struggle and have made mistakes, so that students don't see academia as an impentetrable fortress where wrong answers are always penalized. 

Ultimately, *Teaching to Transgress* is helping me to see where, in the past, I've sometimes thought that teaching 'wasn't for me.' I think what I've really been responding to, in thinking that, is a rejection of teaching as domination, whereas teaching as liberation and teaching as a means to stronger democracy seems exhilarating, if still full of challenges. 

**Reading Reflection, #3:**

*Reading:* Manca, A., Atenas, J., Ciociola, C., & Nascimbeni, F. (2017). Critical pedagogy and open data for educating towards social cohesion. *Italian Journal of Educational Technology, 25*(1), 111-115. doi:10.17471/2499-4324/917.

While this article could have been more fleshed out, I appreciated reading about critical pedagogy concepts as applied to open data. My favorite part of this article talked about how teaching open data can making hidden information visible, and promote substantive democracy (p. 112). "We claim that these dynamics, which influence society by creating or perpetuating its hegemonic structures, can be uncovered, accessed and analysed through the information provided by open data," (p. 112).
