## Data Literacy Lesson Notes for Reproducibility

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**
- Define 'data,' 'big data,' and 'open data.'
- Articulate ethical implications of health data collection/sharing for patient privacy, and contemplate the implications of data ownership for themselves and patients.
- Understand how bias can influence data collection, interpretation, and visualization, as well as under there's no such thing as 'computer-generated' data.
- Know how to find data sources, particularly on open government data websites such as the CDC, NIH, data.gov, etc.
- Ultimately, walk away knowing how to evaluate data sources more effectively, and more thoughtful about how and why data is now intertwined in our daily lives. 
     
**PEDAGOGICAL FOUNDATIONS**

I drew most heavily from the following pedagogical ideas:
- bell hooks' idea of acknowledging students as 'whole human beings' (1994, p. 15) and helping them to see the human side of data (plus, trying to bring my own sense of passion and excitement for data into the classroom to resist the Freire's 'banking system' of education)
- Making hidden information visible (Manca, Atenas, Ciociola, & Nascimbeni, 2017) in the form of asking students to think about data ownership, security, and privacy as well as talking about the flaws of computer-generated data and open data in general
- Using 'problem-posing' (Jacobs, 2010) to make students think critically about information sources

I also drew inspiration for class session activities, as well as some theory of data literacy, from:
- [Creating Data Literate Students](http://datalit.sites.uofmhosting.net/books/book/#toc) (Fontichiaro, Oehrli, & Lennex, 2015) - mostly chapter 3, which helped me create the main activity

*Slide Notes*
- For slide 7, "The Stakes," I had the following notes: How do we determine the risks and benefits of sharing health and medical data? When is it worth it lose a little privacy to further medical research? When is it worth it to potentially risk data security for the convenience of various apps, websites, etc.? How would you ever know you got your 10,000 steps again? A lot of these discussions come down to ownership, power, and trust -- much like we talked about last week. If a tech company owns all of your health data, do you have any power to control these situations anyway? Should you trust those tech companies? These are decisions we all have to make, and we often make them without thinking them through very carefully. In the health world, especially, it can be our health, or even our life, on the line when we’re being asked to give up this data, so it’s important to think through what that power dynamic means for patients. 
- For slide 14, "Data Myths," I talked about FitBit's issues with reading heart rates for people of color ([STAT](https://www.statnews.com/2019/07/24/fitbit-accuracy-dark-skin/)), as well as this ['data detective' piece from Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-a-data-detective-exposed-suspicious-medical-trials/) on how a curious anaesthetist exposed suspcious medical trials' data. 

**DISCUSSION QUESTIONS**

*Part 1: Data in our Personal Lives*
- What is data?
- What are some ways you created data today?
- What health data is collected on patients?
- Who owns all that data?

*Part 2: Thinking About & Using Data (Online on Canvas)*

- What are some steps you can take to ensure patients are informed and aware of your organization’s data policies?
- If you use or regularly refer to any health data sources that we didn’t talk about in class, let us know what they are.
- During our data discussion, did anything surprise you, or make you think differently? Explain.
- Would your literature review benefit from a data source? (To note, no one answered yes to this, but this might have been because the session was fairly late in the quarter.)

**ACTIVITY**

(Note: as mentioned above, this activity was based on a similar activity found in Chapter 3, "Using Data in the Research Process," from [Creating Data Literate Students](http://datalit.sites.uofmhosting.net/books/book/#toc).)

1. Find a news article in which the same data source is cited several times, but with different conclusions. I found the article by using search terms such as 'data conflict,' 'government data,' and other similar terms. (Wish I'd kept better track, used a few.) For this activity, I used this article, "[White House: the opioid epidemic cost $2.5 trillion over 4 years](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/1/20943599/opioid-epidemic-cost-white-house-economic-advisers)," in Vox by German Lopez, published November 1, 2019.
2. Ask students to read the article and then answer the following questions ([handout](https://github.com/kthrog/DFW-TA/blob/master/classSession/DataLiteracyActivity.docx)):
- What data sources are referenced in this article? 
- For you to better understand this article, what other data might have been helpful to know?
- Why do you think the overall costs of the opioid epidemic cited in this article conflict so much?
3. For this article, the main data source used was the CDC Wonder database, CDC's National Vital Statistics (Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts), and DHHS's SAMHSA, as well as  several outside data reports, including several from Altarum. 
4. Discuss how data is visualized to tell a certain story, and discuss conflicts in data representation, even when using the same data source.

**NOTES & REFLECTIONS**

Facilitating the first discussion, going through the slides, and having students complete the activity and discuss it, this session took about 40 minutes. Overall, I think it went well, and students were very engaged with the first discussion. They also did well with the activity, but some students weren't quite sure how to go about finding the data sources (a few hoped to see a reference list). I did my best to explain that post-academia, information sources won't always be laid out in a nice and simple reference list like they are in academic journals (if only). 

I also noticed that once I started going over places to actually search, view, and download data, students, at least to me, didn't seem quite as engaged as before. I think if I were doing this over, I might show just one source in-depth, or leave the discussion of where to find data and how to use it for a separate talk. Still, I think having students interrogate data ownership, privacy, and visualization/representation in media reporting is valuable on its own, and based on the Canvas discussions, resonated with some students.

In future, I'd also like to do more in-depth research on what exactly happens with patient health data once it enters a point-of-care system like Epic. I did some in advance of this class, but don't feel I fully understand or can explain how it works. Though every organization is different, I think having a more solid foundation of what data policy looks like in health organizations would be helpful.

I also didn't have as much time as I wanted to talk about open data, but again, that could have been an entire class session. 

**RECOMMENDED DATA SOURCES**
- [data.CDC.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/)
- [CDC Wonder Database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/)
- [CDC National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/index.htm) 
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) 
- [Data.WA.gov](https://data.wa.gov/)
- [DHHS Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/)
- [NIH Influenze Research Database](https://www.fludb.org)
- [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/)
- [Partners in Information Access for the Public Health Workforce | Health Data, Tools, and Statistics](https://www.phpartners.org/ph_public/health_stats)

To note, there have been various changes at SAMHSA, documented by the Sunlight Foundation [here](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2019/10/22/recent-samhsa-website-overhaul-likely-left-users-confused-frustrated-and-irritated/) and [here](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2019/10/22/a-huge-loss-or-a-skewed-dataset/). 

ICPSR, while not explicity health data, is a source I would highly recommend showing to students to assist with the Ethnomed project, as it has a lot of cultural and demographic data, and could be useful for gathering data on a particular population. 

**EXAMPLE DATASETS**

I ended up not using any of these, but they could be incorporated in future: 
- [Adult Respite Care Funded or Provided by State Governments | National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/6584/summary) (found in ICPSR)
- [National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS-2013) | data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-survey-of-substance-abuse-treatment-services-n-ssats-2013)
- [Health Care Provider Credential Data | data.wa.gov](https://data.wa.gov/Health/Health-Care-Provider-Credential-Data/qxh8-f4bd)


**PATIENT DATA SECURITY EVOLUTION**

If this class was to be taught again, I think it will be worthwhile to monitor the ongoing avalanche of news about Google's 'Project Nightingale,' the name they gave their project to acquire lots of health data from Ascension Health as they took them on as a cloud-computing customer. I've been seeing constant articles about this (both for and against) since the news broke a few weeks ago, and I think it's likely to have reverberating effects across healthcare and data privacy for some time. A few articles I've come across:
- [Could health data privacy kill you? | The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/471360-could-health-data-privacy-kill-you)  --> about data gaps, and how more health data might actually help us fight illness and disease more effectively; this article also contains an 'updated' HIPAA oath with health data privacy clauses added
- [I'm the Google whistleblower. The medical data of millions of Americans is at risk | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/im-the-google-whistleblower-the-medical-data-of-millions-of-americans-is-at-risk)

And then, of course, there's the recent news from Pew Research Center, that American trust in data privacy is incredibly low: 
- [Americans and Privacy: Concerned, Confused and Feeling Lack of Control Over Their Personal Information](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/)
