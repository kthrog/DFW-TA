## Data Literacy Lesson Notes for Reproducibility

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**
- Define 'data,' 'big data,' and 'open data.'
- Articulate ethical implications of health data collection/sharing for patient privacy.
- Understand how bias can influence data collection, interpretation, and visualization.
- Know how to find data sources, particularly on open government data websites such as CDC, NIH, data.gov, etc.
     
**PEDAGOGICAL FOUNDATIONS**

I drew most heavily from the following pedagogical ideas:
- bell hooks' idea of acknowledging students as 'whole human beings' (1994, p. 15) and helping them to see the human side of data (plus, trying to bring my own sense of passion and excitement for data into the classroom to resist the 'banking system' of education)
- Making hidden information visible (Manca, Atenas, Ciociola, & Nascimbeni, 2017) in the form of talking about the flaws of computer-generated data and open data in general
- Using 'problem-posing' (Jacobs, 2010) to make students think critically about information sources

I also drew inspiration for pedagogical thinking and class session activites from:
- [Creating Data Literate Students](http://datalit.sites.uofmhosting.net/books/book/#toc) (Fontichiaro, Oehrli, & Lennex, 2015) - mostly chapter 3, which I used to create the activity
