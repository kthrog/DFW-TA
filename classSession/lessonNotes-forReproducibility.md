## Data Literacy Lesson Notes for Reproducibility

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**
- Define 'data,' 'big data,' and 'open data.'
- Articulate ethical implications of health data collection/sharing for patient privacy, and contemplate the implications of data ownership for themselves and patients.
- Understand how bias can influence data collection, interpretation, and visualization, as well as under there's no such thing as 'computer-generated' data.
- Know how to find data sources, particularly on open government data websites such as the CDC, NIH, data.gov, etc.
- Ultimately, walk away knowing how to evaluate data sources more effectively, and more thoughtful about how and why data is now intertwined in our daily lives. 
     
**PEDAGOGICAL FOUNDATIONS**

I drew most heavily from the following pedagogical ideas:
- bell hooks' idea of acknowledging students as 'whole human beings' (1994, p. 15) and helping them to see the human side of data (plus, trying to bring my own sense of passion and excitement for data into the classroom to resist the Freire's 'banking system' of education)
- Making hidden information visible (Manca, Atenas, Ciociola, & Nascimbeni, 2017) in the form of asking students to think about data ownership, security, and privacy as well as talking about the flaws of computer-generated data and open data in general
- Using 'problem-posing' (Jacobs, 2010) to make students think critically about information sources

I also drew inspiration for class session activities, as well as some theory of data literacy, from:
- [Creating Data Literate Students](http://datalit.sites.uofmhosting.net/books/book/#toc) (Fontichiaro, Oehrli, & Lennex, 2015) - mostly chapter 3, which helped me create the main activity

**CLASS AGENDA**
- Discussion: Data in our Personal Lives
- Data Definitions
- The Stakes
- Activity: Uncovering Data Sources
- Data Myths
- Using Data in your Research
- Discussion: Thinking About & Using Data

**DISCUSSION QUESTIONS**

*Part 1: Data in our Personal Lives*
- What is data?
- What are some ways you created data today?
- What health data is collected on patients?
- Who owns all that data?

*Part 2: Thinking About & Using Data (Online on Canvas)*

- What are some steps you can take to ensure patients are informed and aware of your organization’s data policies?
- If you use or regularly refer to any health data sources that we didn’t talk about in class, let us know what they are.
- During our data discussion, did anything surprise you, or make you think differently? Explain.
- Would your literature review benefit from a data source? (To note, no one answered yes to this, but this might have been because the session was fairly late in the quarter.)

**ACTIVITY**

(Note: as mentioned above, this activity was based on a similar activity found in Chapter 3, "Using Data in the Research Process," from [Creating Data Literate Students](http://datalit.sites.uofmhosting.net/books/book/#toc).)
