**RESPONSIVENESS:** How will I engage studentsâ€™ cultures and other dimensions of diversity? Have I inquired into the Culture of the classroom/ cultural frameworks of the students?
- [ ] Data is often seen as objective in American scientific culture; I want to combat this idea with well-rounded data literacy, while still showing data to be one useful tool among many, when practicing evidence-based medicine.

**INFORMATION LITERACY LESSON PLAN:** Are there any students who belong to a cultural group with specific needs to address (e.g.
physical or learning disability, English Language Learners, etc.)? How can I address these needs? (Review limitations Kimberly sent.) Whose voice/perspective is being privileged by this lesson? Which DISCOURSE STYLES are being utilized in this lesson? What examples/metaphors/search terms will I use? Are these culturally relevant and appropriate to students?
- [ ] Discourse styles: lecture, group discussion, co-learning as we browse data repositories together
