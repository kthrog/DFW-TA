##Lesson Plan Brainstorming

**Want to cover two aspects of data literacy:**
1. 'big data' and data privacy 
2. open data and making public work more visible and accesible to the general public by releasing data 

**Q&A period at beginning:**
- Start by asking students to name ways they might have created data today
- Then ask students who owns that data they've created -- are they comfortable with that ownership?
- Relate this to health data in the CHED and HSM worlds -- how much patient data is being created, who owns it, and is that structure working?
