## Lesson Plan Brainstorming

**Three data literacy concepts to cover:**
1. Big Data
2. Data Privacy 
3. Open Data + Data Repositories + Making Data More Accessible to a Larger Audience

**Q&A period at beginning:**
- Start by asking students to name ways they might have created data today
- Then ask students who owns that data they've created -- are they comfortable with that ownership?
- Relate this to health data in the CHED and HSM worlds -- how much patient data is being created, who owns it, and is that structure working? How much health data should be kept private, and how much should be shared for the public good? And of the data that's private, is it even accessible to the patients themselves? Why is this? Can we change it? Should we change it?

**Quick overview (slides) to lecture on (no more than 10 minutes):**
- Definitions
- Ethics
- Use cases
- Emphasize that data is just part of the picture, and it is not objective or unbiased - that 'data doesn't lie' is actually untrue!
